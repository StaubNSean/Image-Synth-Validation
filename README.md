# Image-Synthesis-Analysis
School project focused on validating image synthesis/analysis:  

This purpose of this project is to gain experience that will further enable me to achieve a career as an optical engineer in the augmented reality industry.
The overall goal for this project is to develop skills and gain knowledge of image synthesis and image analysis in a way that is relevant to the optical engineering of imaging devices.  

More specifically, I aim to:
    •	Understand the imaging chain of digital cameras that is used in research and development.  
  o	In addition to the material learned in class, I will be studying Modeling the Imaging Chain of Digital Cameras by Robert D. Fiete.  
•	Learn how to use Prysm, a physical optics modeling/data analysis package for Python.  
  o	Prysm will be used to synthesize slanted edge and Siemen’s star images that are accurate representations of images captured by a given digital camera.  
•	Learn how to use MTF-Mapper, a collection of tools to measure edge acuity using MTF50 (Modulation Transfer Funcion) values.  
  o	MTF-Mapper will be used to validate the image synthesis done using Prysm, and to compare calculated MTF values against those found through Sam Thurman’s MTF estimation algorithm.  
•	Implement Sam Thurman’s MTF estimation algorithm for Siemens' star images.  
  o	The MTF values calculated using this algorithm will be compared to those found by using MTF-Mapper.  
•	Produce a project paper that details the theory, methods, and results of this project.
